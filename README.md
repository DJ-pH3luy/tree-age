# tree-age - a small script to count tree rings

Disclaimer: Heavily depends on good quality pictures. Uses some basic digital image processing algorithms. Your mileage may vary.


The program will save visualizations of each step taken to ./doc/ after it was executed. In ./requirements.txt are the two libraries I used for this project.

main.py doesn't take any arguments, its variables can be adjusted via global constants in the script itself.
