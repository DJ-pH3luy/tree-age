The program will save visualizations of each step taken to ./doc/ after it was executed.
I didn't include any of my own generated pictures in this zip file because it would have been kinda large. 

In ./requirements.txt are the two libraries I used for this project.

main.py doesn't take any arguments, its variables can be adjusted via global constants in the script itself.  

Heavily depends on good quality pictures. Uses some basic digital image processing algorithms. Your mileage may wary.
